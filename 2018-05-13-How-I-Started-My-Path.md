**How I Started My Path to Financial Independence**

Wondering how you even start on the path to FI? Here are the steps that I took and recommend. 

1.	*Take advantage of matching.* I took advantage of my work’s matching in my 401K. My work matches 5% if I also put in 5% of my paychecks into my 401K. This is money that belongs to you that you are letting your work keep if you don't take advantage of the full matching.  

2.	*Track expenses.* I tracked my expenses in a simple excel spreadsheet so I know how much money I spend every month.  I enter my expenses into categories (food, rent, cell phone bill, house stuff, etc. ) once a week and total it. At the end of the month, I summarize what I spend in a [pivot table] (https://www.gcflearnfree.org/excel2013/pivottables/2/) and determine if there are purchases that I could minimize. 

3.	*Cut expenses.* This is an on-going process.  I continually test whether or not I could live without something. For example, I used to buy Soda Stream canisters each month.  Could I live without seltzer water?  I tested it out and stopped buying it for a month.  Turns out I can. I’m doing a similar test with my rent. Can I live in a cheaper apartment without being miserable? 

4.	*Set a budget.*  Once I shaved my expenses as much as I could without seriously diminishing my quality of life, I set this as my budget.  Even still, I’m often under this amount by $200-$400 each month. 

5.	*Pay in cash.*  I determined how much money I could spend a week to remain in budget and withdrew this from my bank every month in cash to develop a habit of thinking carefully before I make a purchase. It is more "painful" to [pay with cash then credit](http://danariely.com/2013/03/21/cash-versus-credit/), which is good if the goal is to minimize spending.

6.	*Minimize debt.*  I would pay off credit card and student loan debt as much as possible.  I was fortunate enough to not have debt, but this is what I would do if I did.  

7.	*Open a Vanguard Roth (or traditional) IRA and max it out.*  Most people can [contribute at least $5,500 a year] (https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-iras-contributions) to an IRA.  I do this and max it out at the beginning of the year so it can grow as quickly as possible. I prefer Vanguard because it has the lowest fees. 

8.	*Consolidate retirement accounts.* I had a small amount of money in an IRA in Fidelity from a previous job that I had in the bank. I moved it into my Vanguard IRA account so I only have to manage one account.  Count this contribution towards the $5,500 that is allowed every year. 

9.	*Max out contributions to a 401K.* Now I know what I need to live on thanks to my budget, I determined that if I max out my 401K contributions (currently $18,500), I would still have plenty to live off of.  That is somewhere around $712 bi-weekly since there are 26 pay periods in a year. Bonus, this bumped me into a lower tax bracket, so I should pay less taxes this year. 

10.	*Call my dad and make sure I’m not doing something crazy by investing in the stock market.*  Sometimes you just need a little moral support. 

11.	*Move money into a taxable account.* Woo! I still have money left over after following my skinny budget. Since I maxed out my 401k and Roth IRA, I moved this money into a taxable account. I have 3 months of money in my savings account for emergencies.  Everything else goes into this taxable account. 

12.	*Buy admiral shares in Vanguard.* Once I had enough money in my Vanguard Roth IRA and taxable accounts, I moved this money into admiral shares (VSTAX requires $10,000 to invest) because it has a lower expense ratio. 

Voila! Those are the steps I took. Now I work on generating more income to feed those accounts through side hustles and cutting expenses, such as moving into a cheaper apartment.
