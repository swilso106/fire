**A skill for working towards financial independence**

In order to work towards financial independence, I needed to build a few skills first.  An important skill I developed was the ability to delay gratification, at least when it came to spending money.  Sexy, I know.  Once I developed the skill, though, it became ingrained and, like any true habit, effortless.  How did I develop this skill?  When I felt the first itch of a desire for something, I would wait instead of buying it immediately, sometimes weeks, to see if it would remain.  When I want something, I give my mind some time and space to toss the desire around for a while, like flipping a stone in my hand, feeling the edges smooth, questioning everything.  For example, at one time I wanted a food processor.  I asked myself questions about it: Why did I want it? What would I use it for? Where would I put it? Am I really going to use it? Do I realize that it’s a pain to clean? How much was I willing to spend on it? Could I find one for free? Then I would visualize myself using the food processor: tossing food into it, listening to its noisy clatter, quieting it, scraping out the sides of bowl, pulling it apart, washing each individual piece, drying each individual piece, shoving the pieces underneath my counter to become forgotten and gather dust.  And so it would go.  After giving my mind this time and space to mull things over, one day it made itself up.  The stone stilled in my hand. I knew it was more trouble than it was worth.  I slowly placed the stone on the floor and walked away.  I knew it was more trouble than it was worth.  That’s delaying gratification.
