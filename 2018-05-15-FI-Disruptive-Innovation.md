** Financial Independence: the Disruptive Innovation of Retirement and Personal Finance **

Several of the famous bloggers have noted how prevalent software engineers are within the financial independence / Early Retirement community.  For example, (Mr. Money Moustache)[https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/], the (Mad Fientist)[ https://www.madfientist.com/], Mr. Frugalwoods [https://www.frugalwoods.com/], and (Mr. 1500)[ https://www.1500days.com/about-me/] are all prominent bloggers in the FI /RE community and are all …or rather, were … software engineers.  The Mad Fientist even points out in his (Financial Independence podcast)[ https://www.madfientist.com/podcast/] that the movement seems to be dominated by software engineers.  I have also personally witnessed this when I attend FI meetups; at least one person who works at Google always attends and at least a handful of other software engineers attend as well.  And the rest of the crowd is mostly made up of people in the financial industry. 

I think it makes sense that software engineers are interested in FI/RE.  Just like many aspects of the tech industry itself, I think of FI as a disruptive innovation of retirement and personal finance and the larger consumerist society.  Just like Uber disrupts how people think about calling a taxi or AirBnb disrupts how people book a hotel room, FI disrupts the typical path people follow when thinking about retirement. The typical adult’s financial path is to work, buy stuff, buy a house if possible, and then retire at age 65 if you’re lucky.  To achieve FI/RE, on the other hand, I must slash my monthly costs, pump 50-70% of my paycheck into retirement accounts, perhaps never buy a house, and be able to retire at age 40.  In fact, it’s a disruption of the entire consumerist society because I am choosing to max out my 401K at the age of 27 rather than spend it on cars or clothes or travel.  Since disruptive innovation is such a large part of the tech industry, I think it only makes sense that software engineers - people who are interested in optimizing and disrupting the status quo- would also be interested in hacking their path to retirement as well.
