**Why I Choose to Invest in VSTAX?**

First, [VSTAX]( https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundIntExt=INT&FundId=0585&ps_disable_redirect=true) is Vanguard’s Total Stock Market Index Fund, admiral shares. The initial investment is $10,000 to invest. [VTSMX ]( https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0085&FundIntExt=INT&funds_disable_redirect=true) is Vanguard’s Total Stock Market Index Fund, investor shares.  The initial investment is $3,000. Both funds invest in the entire U.S. stock market, splitting your investment in all 3637 stocks.   The initial investment amounts are different and the admiral shares expense ratio is lower (0.04% for VSTAX v. 0.14% VTSMX), but they are otherwise the same. 

Just like everyone who tries to play the stock market has their own winning strategy and winning stock, every person pursuing financial independence seems to have their favorite investment strategy.  There are two tenants, however, that I have seen over and over again: 1) diversify the investment and 2) invest in funds with low expense ratios (that is fees that Vanguard and other companies charge to manage the funds).  Since VSTAX is the total stock market, you can’t find a more diversified single index fund.  It also has the lowest expense ratio at 0.04% that I’ve been able to find. 

I think of investing as a spectrum.  At the one end is investing in VSTAX with the lowest expense ratio and the most diversification.  At the other end is a complex, energy-intensive strategy of buying what someone thinks is a winning single stock and timing to make sure they pull money out of the stock market at its peak worth, which [people argue even the pros can’t do](http://jlcollinsnh.com/2012/04/25/stocks-part-iii-most-people-lose-money-in-the-market/).  And then there is everything else in between.  The in-between includes buying several different stocks; buying several different index funds; balancing to include international stocks, commodities, real estate, and bonds; buying index fund that are weighted, etc. 

For me, I’ve decided to start simple and invest in the most basic, well –diversified, low-fee index fund and see if it generates some income.  Because here’s a secret:  I’m fairly lazy and I’m actually not that excited about learning about investing.  I’m interested in financial independence and the freedom that comes with it and investing is a means to this end.  If a simple approach can work, then that’s the approach that I would prefer to take.  

One of the biggest hurdles for me, and my guess is this is true for most people, is just setting up the account and actually investing the money.  Once I started investing, all I needed to do is pump money into the accounts. That’s the easy part. The hard part is figuring out what accounts to set-up.  It’s a scary first step to invest thousands of dollars, especially as a young person who is early in her career.  However, I knew it was important to start as young as possible, so I had to do something instead of doing endless research and reading an endless pile of books and remaining stuck in what my dad calls “analysis paralysis”. VSTAX was an easy first step that had the characteristics I had read about time-and-again: diversification and a low expense ratio. 

I choose to invest in VSTAX because it matches my current sophistication when it comes to personal finance.  For the time-being, VSTAX works, it’s simple, it makes sense to me.  As I get older and learn more, I predict I will discover new strategies that will make sense to me and choose to invest differently as my knowledge becomes more sophisticated.  Great!  And I’ll make sure to share this information with you, my dear reader, so you can walk with me on this journey.
