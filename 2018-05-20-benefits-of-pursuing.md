**The benefits of pursuing financial independence **

I think one of the most challenging aspects of pursuing financial independence (FI) for people is the thought of waiting a decade or even more before achieving it.  What I have discovered, however, is that I am reaping tremendous benefits even though I just started on this path. The benefits come in several forms, the four c’s:  

1.	*I am more creative.* I have found new ways of acquiring things I want or need without buying them.  I do this through the free list on Craigslist or through (Buy Nothing groups)[ https://buynothingproject.org/find-a-group/]. I’ve also found that friends are happy to let me borrow tools and equipment they own (and likely rarely use).  In addition, I have started making my own things, such as reusable produce bags, clothing, and jewelry. 

2.	*I am more connected.* I am now an active participant in three financial independence groups that meet in person.  I have also started volunteering and joined a small business to replace the time I spent shopping or attending paid events.  

3.	*I am more content.*  I am more satisfied with the things I already own since I no longer buy everything that I want as soon as I want it.  

4.	*I am more confident.*  Since I know I am taking care of myself financially and diversifying my source of income, I feel more confident in pursuing riskier projects at work and clearly stating what I am looking for from jobs and side hustles.   

I have heard people express concerns about pursuing FI because they fear that their quality of life will diminish.  I experienced the exact opposite.  By pursuing FI, I have found that my quality of life has immediately, dramatically, and continually increased.
